- [Hardhat Deploy](https://hardhat.org/plugins/hardhat-deploy.html) plugin to easily deploy contracts
- [Hardhat watcher](https://hardhat.org/plugins/hardhat-watcher.html) plugin to help with TDD
- [Ethereum Waffle](https://hardhat.org/plugins/nomiclabs-hardhat-waffle.html) to make testing super easy
- [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) to interact with the smart contract through javascript
- [Solidity Coverage](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage) to get code coverage for contracts
